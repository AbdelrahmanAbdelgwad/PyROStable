# PyROStable
PyROStable is a Python library designed for applying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to self-balancing robots. The goal of the library is to provide a safe haven for anyone who wants to explore the potential of RL in the context of self-balancing, allowing easy comparison with traditional control algorithms.
